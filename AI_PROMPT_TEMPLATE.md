```

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: AI generates markdown formatting

- **Solution**: Emphasize "NO markdown" in your prompt, or manually remove \*_ and _ characters

**Problem**: Content too long for slides

- **Solution**: Ask AI to "keep each text block under 2 sentences"

**Problem**: Numbers not formatted well

- **Solution**: Specify "use short formats like 4.4T, 84%, 10x"

**Note**: This template is designed to work with YOUR carousel generator. The AI will automatically handle color palettes, templates, and visual design when you paste the content and click "Generate with AI".
